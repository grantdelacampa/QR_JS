# QR_JS

This project is being built just to test my programming skills. I wanted to write a QR generator that doesn't use any external packages, and still maintains fast generation speeds.

**This project is still in Alpha please be aware if you want to fork it**

## Current Bugs
- Generation starts failing after version 9

## Current Features
- Black and white QR generation from v1-v40
- Modes for numeric, alphanumeric, and byte.
- Variable error correction mode selection.

## Planned Features
- Allow the user to change the colors for the 0 and 1 pixels.
- Allow variable whitespace size.
- Kanji Mode
- Better react integration
- Publish package to NPM

## Generation overview
1. Choose Mode
2. TODO
